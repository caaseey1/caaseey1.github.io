<center><h1>The Skills Gap in Information Technology and Cybersecurity: A Recommendation Report</h1></center>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>
	To determine the best way to mitigate and correct the technical and interpersonal skills gap in Information Technology and Cybersecurity, Dr. Gia Alexander asked me to study this academic journals, news articles, national trends and present the findings and recommendations.</br></br>

	According to CompTIA, eight in ten companies with an information technology focus feel that there is a skills gap, with fifty-five percent of cybersecurity focused groups concerned about a serious skills gap (2017). Additionally, the technology industry, in its fashion of iterative, constant development, there will be a matching rise in specific skills demand increasing the skills gap that already exists (Schirf & Serapiglia, 2017). Currently, there is nothing addressing this issue despite the fact that major industry players are aware of its existence and its problems. </br></br>

	To carry out this study, I completed the tasks described in my proposal of October 27, 2018: I researched the technology skills gap in new hires, I investigated the correlations in skill gap focuses in general Information Technology and Cybersecurity, I identified the focus points of cybersecurity and information technology that are most affected by a skills gap, and I investigated the ramifications caused by the skills gap and proposed applicable solutions.</br></br>


	The main finding is that the gap in both technical and soft skills in Information Technology and Cybersecurity is extremely prevalent in new hires and other existing employees. Within Information Technology professionals, it is seen that there is a significant skills gap in soft, communication skills and business management skills. With improved skills, Information Technology professionals can cultivate standards of enablers of business rather than the keepers of technology (Gorman, 2011).  Within Cybersecurity, the soft skills lacking in employees and new hires is parallel to that seen within Information Technology professionals. Cybersecurity as an industry is seen to have a much larger skills gap in the area of technical skills and abilities. The Cybersecurity industry is a moving target in education and in industry, its nature to constantly evolve and to become more complex by the hour easily produces a clearly noticeable skills gap. Most new and available Cybersecurity positions require the skills and often the years of someone who has been employed for at least ten years. Due to this, in 2015 there was over 210,000 available and unfilled positions (Schirf & Serapiglia, 2017). It is extraordinarily difficult to find a security professional with these qualifications. The Cybersecurity industry really started increasing in relevancy in the early 2000â€™s, so to require every security professional to have over ten years of quality security experience is part of the problem. College graduates with degrees in Computer Science or similar fields experience a disconnect in the skills they possess and what is unrealistically required by the industry. The Cybersecurity skills gap is extraordinarily important and will be disastrous if not addressed and remediated rapidly (CompTIA, 2017). 
  </br></br>

	I recommend one of the following courses of action: increased mandatory curriculum in educational environments (colleges, universities, or vocational programs) that focus on skills needed for new hires in the workforce, the creation and use of workforce-development programs, or a combination of the two. I believe that overcoming the skills gap is absolutely essential before it becomes irreversible. Considering the implementation of these courses of action will greatly help to train new hires to be better equipped to succed in their careers, will keep current employees up to date on new technologies and foster and environment of learning, and will greatly reduce or completely eliminate the skills gap in the Information Technology or Cybersecurity industries.</br></br>
