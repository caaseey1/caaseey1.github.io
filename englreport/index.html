	Attached is the report for my study, "The Skills Gap in Information Technology and Cybersecurity: A Recommendation Report".	The tasks detailed in the proposal of October 19, 2018: to research the technology skills gap in new hires, to investigate the correlations between general technology and cybersecurity, to identify the focus points of cybersecurity and information technology that are most affected by a skills gap, to and investigate the ramifications caused by the skills gap and propose applicable solutions have been completed.</br></br>

	These tasks were completed by the performance of primary and secondary research. Surveys were developed within Qualtrics and distributed as a method of primary research. I also studied literature on the technical and soft skills gap in Information Technology and Cybersecurity, on mechanisms for professional learning and growth of employees, and on related risks to the industries if the gaps persist. As data was collected, I analyzed and compiled the information, built the website to host the report, and wrote the report.</br></br>

	The main findings conclude that the gap in both technical and soft skills in Information Technology and Cybersecurity is extremely prevalent in new hires and other existing employees. For example, students becoming new hires may possess the necessary technical skills for their respective position, however the ability to solve complex problems, their analytical and research skills, and they lack the ability to communicate properly both in written and oral environments (Schirf & Serapiglia, 2017). This skills gap can be mitigated or even corrected, but for this progress, we must increase our understanding of the issue through research and analysis as seen in this study.</br></br>

	I recommend one of the following courses of action: increased mandatory curriculum in educational environments (colleges, universities, or vocational programs) that focus on skills needed for new hires in the workforce, the creation and use of workforce-development programs, or a combination of the two. I appreciate the support and trust shown throughout the course of this study and I look forward to further work and research on this topic in the future.
