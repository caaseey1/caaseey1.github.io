<center><h1>The Skills Gap in Information Technology and Cybersecurity: A Recommendation Report</h1></center>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>
	I recommend that the Information Technology, Cybersecurity, and education community pursue one of these two options, if not both: </br>
</p>

<h4>Option 1: To increase mandatory curriculum in educational environments (colleges, universities, or vocational programs) that focus on skills, including business, interpersonal, and technical, needed for new hires in the workforce.</h4>
<p>
	Although the concept of a nation-wide mandate for increased classes in Information Technology and Cybersecurity is impractical, some implementatiom of new coursework mandating that every student, no matter the degree, was required to take business focused classes, to take classes or gain experience in interpersonal situations, and to take basic technical skills classes would be fantastic. Non-technical students might not feel they should be required to take basic Information Technology and Cybersecurity classes, but if they were exposed to crucial skills such as these, they would have better knowledge and security for themselves and their lives that could not hurt their career. For students in Information Technology and Cybersecurity majors, they would take the same introductory technical courses to ensure that a solid base of knowledge would be possessed. Then, based upon their career trajectories they would take specific and highly technical classes that would really prepare them for work in industry.   </br></br>

	If it is not possible to add this coursework to university and vocation settings, then an extracurricular program that at least provided some exposure to skills and environments seen within the Information Technology and Cybersecurity industries would be an acceptable option until the mandated coursework kicks in.
</p>

<h4>Option 2: The creation and use of workforce-development programs within professional organizaions.</h4>
<p>
	In a professional setting and beyond the scope of initial employee training, the best way to encourage employees to stay on top of updating and new technologies is professional development opportunities. Without these options, the skills gap will just increase in the organization both in new and existing hires. I recommend the creation and use of workforce-development programs within Information Technology and Professional Organizations. These workforce-development programs should be based upon the following five principles: define geographic assets and identify target professions, deliver ROI to employers and workers, support comprehensive and demand-driven training methods, assess and prepare learners before they start training, coordinate the workforce-development process centrally (Laboissiere & Mourshed, 2017)
