<center><h1>The Skills Gap in Information Technology and Cybersecurity: A Recommendation Report</h1></center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	To determine the best way to mitigate and correct the technical and interpersonal skills gap in Information Technology and Cybersecurity, Dr. Gia Alexander asked me to study this academic journals, news articles, national trends and present the findings and recommendations.</br></br>

	Currently, the skills gap in Information Technology and Cybersecurity is an issue with no solution in sight. Organizations are often leaving the training and maintenance of skills up to the discretion of the employee. This is not helpful for curbing the learning curve and skills gap in new hires, nor is it helpful for keeping up with the development of new technologies and new Cybersecurity threats. This skills gap is not ideal in Information Technology and is nearly catastrophic in Cybersecurity. There is currently no methodology in place to correct this issue. </br></br>

	Therefore, I wished to do research on this issue to better understand the causes for its existence and to develop solution options for this problem. Specifically, I was asked to perform the following four tasks in my research: </br>
	- Research the technology skills gap in new hires.</br>
	- Investigate the correlations between general Information Technology and Cybersecurity.</br>
	- Identify the focus points of Cybersecurity and Information Technology that are most affected by a skills gap.</br>
	- Investigate the ramifications caused by the skills gap and propose applicable solutions. </br>
	</br></br>

	I have found that both of these industries have positions that go unfilled every single year because candidates come out of college with inadequate experience in terms of skills and mandatory years of experience for entry level positions. This is especially a problem in Cybersecurity. The skills gap is a problem that begins within the educational system and stems throughout the working life of an employee.</br></br>

	The principle finding in this study was that the gap in both technical and soft skills in Information Technology and Cybersecurity is extremely prevalent in new hires and other existing employees at various stages of their careers. The primary way for an employee to individually bridge this skills gap is through their own self-learning and professional experience and development. It is often encouraged by organizations to do certain trainings and to pursue continuing education, but it is all at the time and effort of the individual employee. The educational system in place, from vocational schools to four year degrees, often cover only a portion of the technical skills the future hire will need for a career in Information Technology and Cybersecurity. This skills gap is a huge concern and needs desperately to be addressed.</br></br>

	I recommend that increased mandatory curriculum in educational environments (colleges, universities, or vocational programs) that focus on skills, including business, interpersonal, and technical, needed for new hires in the workforce. Additionally, I recommend the creation and use of workforce-development programs. Programs sponsored by the organization, accommodate the employees needs and are nearly required. </br></br>

	In the following sections, I will provide additional information and details about the research, the methods used in research, the results obtained, the analysis and conclusions upon those results, and my recommendation.

</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
	I began the research by compiling a myriad of secondary research and planning and initiating a series of surveys and interviews as primary research. I maintained focus on the priorities and requirements of the research as set by Dr. Alexander.</br></br>

	The focuses for this topic of research were the industries of Cybersecurity and Information Technology, soft and technical skills in new educational program graduates heading towards careers in these fields, and the potential methods to correct the skills gap. </br></br>

	To perform this analysis, I broke the project into the following tasks:</br> 
	1. Acquire a basic understanding of the structure of Information Technology and Cybersecurity industries. </br>
	2. Identify the skills gaps seen in existing workers in the Information Technology and Cybersecurity industries. </br> 
	3. Identify the skills gaps seen in new hires in the Information Technology and Cybersecurity industries. </br> 
	4. Correlate the findings from the first three tasks.</br>
	5. Research solution options to the problem of the skills gap.</br>
	6. Analyze overall research and compile this recommendation report. </br></br>

	The following discussion details how each task was performed.</br></br>

	<b>1. Acquire a basic understanding of the structure of Information Technology and Cybersecurity industries</b></br>
	<b>2. Identify the skills gaps seen in existing workers in the Information Technology and Cybersecurity industries</b></br>
	<b>3. Identify the skills gaps seen in new hires in the Information Technology and Cybersecurity industries</b></b></br>

	For the first three research tasks I obtained the majority of the information through the development of a two phase primary research activity.</b></br></br>

	Participant selection: Participants will be chosen based on their role and time with the organization. The goal is for there to be at least one participant from each level within the IT group in the overall organization, approximately 10 - 15 individuals. If it appears plausible, there will be equivalent male and female participants. The level within the organization and an individualâ€™s exposure to the Information Technology or Cybersecurity field are the criteria upon which participants in the study will be chosen</b></br></br>
	Phase One: The selected participants will complete a survey for phase one of the study to analyze interdepartmental interaction and overall employee satisfaction. </br></br>

	Phase Two: The participants will undergo an observation period and then will complete an unstructured interview for more detailed information regarding the focus of the study, the ever-present skills gap. </br></br>

	Additionally to the primary research, I obtained information from academic journals and other noteworthy sources regarding other research and news on the skills gap in Information Technology and Cybersecurity.

	<b>4. Correlate the findings from the first three tasks</b></br>

	</br></br>
	This graph details the correlated findings on the type of skills gap broken down by industry. I correlated the research from the previous research method tasks and produced this pie chart to visualize the findings.
	</br></br> 
	<b>5. Research solution options to the problem of the skills gap</b></br> 
	This stage of the research was entirely secondary research. I referenced academic journals and a reputable article to begin to theorize potential solutions to the skills gap issue.
	
	</br></br> 
	<b>6. Analyze overall research and compile this recommendation report</b></br>I decided to present this report in the form of a website due to the technical nature of this topic. Therefore the compilation of the recommendation report involved planning and building a website with HTML and CSS, determining the location to host the website (GitHub Pages), and then compiling the research into a report in the format of a website. 
	</br></br> 
</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
	In this section of this report, I present the results of the research. For the tasks carried out, results are reported. </br>
	<b>1. Research the technology skills gap in new hires</b></br>
	<b>2. Investigate the correlations in skill gap focuses in general Information Technology and Cybersecurity</b></br>
	<b>3. Identify the focus points of Cybersecurity and Information Technology that are most affected by a skills gap</b></br></br>
	The skills gap in both technical and soft skills in Information Technology and Cybersecurity is extremely prevalent in new hires and other existing employees. </br></br>
	In the past, information technology has been branded by the mindset of themselves and of others within their organization as those who do their technology work and keep to themselves. However, this attitude of separation is toxic to overall organization development. It can lead to decreased productivity and decreased communication. IT professionals should be developing and adapting to the increasingly connected world by increasing their skill sets. Within IT professionals, there is a significant skills gap in soft, communication skills and business management skills. With improved skills, Information Technology professionals can cultivate standards of enablers of business rather than the keepers of technology (Gorman, 2011). Information technology services are supposed to bring efficiency and project management skills to the organization, an increase in communication and business management skills by information technology employees and professionals could easily bridge this gap.  </br></br>
	The cybersecurity industry is a moving target in education and in industry, its nature to constantly evolve and to become more complex by the hour easily produces a clearly noticeable skills gap. Most new and available cybersecurity positions require the skills and often the years of someone who has been employed for at least ten years. Due to this, in 2015 there was over 210,000 available and unfilled positions (Schirf & Serapiglia, 2017). It is extraordinarily difficult to find a security professional with these qualifications. The Cybersecurity industry really started increasing in relevancy in the early 2000â€™s, so to require every security professional to have over ten years of quality security experience is part of the problem. College graduates with degrees in computer science or similar fields experience a disconnect in the skills they possess and what is unrealistically required by the industry. The Cybersecurity skills gap is extraordinarily important and will be disastrous if not addressed and remediated rapidly (CompTIA, 2017). </br></br>
	
	</br></br> 
	<b>4. Investigate the ramifications caused by the skills gap and propose applicable solutions</b></br></br>
	I used information gathered in the surveys and interviews along with secondary research sources to compile solution possibilities to the skills gap issue. From the primary research, I gathered that employers wish educational systems did more to prepare new hires for working in Industry. Additionally, the Information Technology and Cybersecurity professionals wished for better, industry supported, workforce-development programs to instill a spirit of constant learning with workers and to keep knowledge up to date with the perpetually changing nature of technology.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>

	<b>Research the technology skills gap in new hires</b>
	</br>
	<b>Investigate the correlations in skill gap focuses in general Information Technology and Cybersecurity</b></br> 
	<b>Identify the focus points of Cybersecurity and Information Technology that are most affected by a skills gap</b></br></br>

	New hires into Information Technology and Cybersecurity are a large amount of employees in industry that show to have a skills gap. This skills gap is largely attributed to the moving targets of evolving technology and the constant changing of necessary skill sets (Schirf & Serapiglia, 2017). Students may possess the necessary technical skills for their respective position, however the ability to solve complex problems, analytical and research skills, and not knowing how to think to communicate properly both written and orally (Schirf & Serapiglia, 2017). These recent graduates often have the greatest potential to succeed as they can be trained to bridge this gap. However, there is general disconnects in their motivation and drive to become a value at the organization, to integrate with the companyâ€™s culture, and for cybersecurity industry a complete lack of understanding of what it takes to succeed and to do well in that industry. </br></br>
	Clearly, a large skills gap and a resulting lack of success exists within the Information Technology and Cybersecurity fields. The goal of this study is to analyze individuals within the industry perception on the issue and to eventually formulate a plan to move forward in bridging this skills gap. 



	</br></br> 
	<b>Investigate the ramifications caused by the skills gap and propose applicable solutions</b></br></br>
	As a result of the research in this study, increased mandatory curriculum in educational environments (colleges, universities, or vocational programs) that focus on skills needed for new hires in the workforce or the creation and use of workforce-development programs would be solutions that could help greatly with the skills gap seen in the Information Technology and Cybersecurity Industries.
